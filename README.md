## Launch & Deployment :technologist:
<a name="launchanddeployment"></a>
### 1. Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js.\
We urge you to install the exact version **v20.11.0** which comes with the npm package manager. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/).\
If you are confused about which download to choose, feel free to use these direct links:

- **MacOS:** [node-v20.11.0.pkg](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0.pkg)
- **Windows 32-bit:** [node-v20.11.0-x86.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-x86.msi)
- **Windows 64-bit:** [node-v20.11.0-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-x64.msi)
- **Linux:** [node-v20.11.0.tar.xz](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64.tar.xz) (use this [installation guide](https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation#how-to-install-nodejs-via-binary-archive-on-linux) if you are new to Linux)

If you happen to have a package manager the following commands can be used:

- **Homebrew:**¬†`brew install node@20.11.0`
- **Chocolatey:**¬†`choco install nodejs-lts --version=20.11.0`

After the installation, update the npm package manager to **10.4.0** by running ```npm install -g npm@10.4.0```\
You can ensure the correct version of node and npm by running ```node -v``` and ```npm --version```, which should give you **v20.11.0** and **10.4.0** respectively.\
Before you start your application for the first time, run this command to install all other dependencies, including React:

```npm install```

Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use a Chrome-based browser).\
The client will send HTTP requests to the server which can be found [here](https://github.com/HASEL-UZH/sopra-fs24-template-server).\
In order for these requests to work, you need to install and start the server as well.

### 2. Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`\
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### 3. Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance:\
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### 4. Deployment on Google Cloud
The application is hosted on [The Price Is Right](https://sopra-fs24-group-18-client.oa.r.appspot.com/)

The Google Cloud Projects are as following:

[Server Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/services?serviceId=default&project=sopra-fs24-group-18-server)
[Client Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/services?serviceId=default&project=sopra-fs24-group-18-client)

To join the projects, please contact lu.li@uzh.ch.


## Roadmap :bulb:
<a name="roadmap"></a>
### 1. Expand User Tools :placard:
Our current set of user tools is limited, but there's significant potential for enhancement. For instance, tools to extend the guessing time, or tools allow collaboration among players.

### 2. More Game Modes :roller_coaster:
While our project currently offers two game modes, there's room for expansion to enrich the gaming experience. For example, modes that allow players to choose specific item categories for guessing, or modes that contain more competitive challenges.

### 3. Enhance Features :star2:
Although our project primarily focuses on the core gameplay experience, there's potential to incorporate additional features to further elevate user engagement. Such as background music (BGM) to enhance the atmosphere, customizable game room backgrounds to personalize the experience, and built-in communication tools to facilitate interaction among players during gameplay sessions.
